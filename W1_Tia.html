            Reflection to Week One Readings
        </h2>
        <main style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">
            In Vannevar Bush’s “As We May Think”, I’m impressed with 
            the evolution of machines which, at the same time, has a strong 
            connection to the progressive path of science and technology. 
            That being said, those eye-opening machines are usually built on 
            new breakthroughs in science, such as theories, discoveries, 
            ideas, you name it. For example, the understanding and 
            utilization of photocells bring photography into the next 
            evolution of advanced photography.

                One thing that stuck out to me in Berners-Lee’s article “Long Live the Web” is that the web belongs to everyone, because everyone could get highly involved in it. For instance, we can turn a document in a local computer into a document embedded in a URL which allows us to share to whoever copies and pastes it on the internet. It is exactly what I am experiencing right now. I can publish the pdf version of my portfolio by clicking “share” and get a URL in no time. Of course, the openness relates to human rights and protocols in the web and internet world. There are standards that the web should follow in order to maintain its openness, free access, separation of layers.
